# G.O.A.T Goals
This is a fullstack CRUD application with authentication that allows users to login and create goals to keep track of. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Packages/Dependencies used:** bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

This application was made using MVC architecture for organization and passport for local authentication and sessions. EJS was used as the templating language to render our HTML. MongoDB was used for storing the data in a database. Mongoose was used to create rigid schemas, keeping our data consistent. 

## Lessons Learned:

-MVC architecture
-Passport authentication
-Using EJS to generate HTML

## Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

`npm install` 

## Things to add

- Create a `.env` file and add the following as `key: value` 
  - PORT: 1212 (can be any port example: 3000) 
  - DB_STRING: `your database URI` 
 
 Have fun testing and improving it! ðŸ˜Ž
